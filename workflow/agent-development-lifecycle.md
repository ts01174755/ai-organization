# Agent Development Lifecycle Workflow

## Overview
Complete agent development workflow from conception to production deployment, including iterative improvement and lifecycle management.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Requirements Analysis & Agent Design
- **agent-incubator**: Create specialized agent based on requirements
- **dynamic-adapter-agent**: Test agent prototype execution

### 2. Quality Evaluation
- **agent-prompt-evaluator**: Evaluate prompt design quality and structure
- **agent-performance-evaluator**: Test agent execution performance with multi-dimensional analysis

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **optimization-strategy-designer**: Generate optimization strategies based on gaps
- **prompt-enhancement-engineer**: Apply optimization strategies to agent prompt

### 4. Validation & Improvement
- **Main Assistant**: Review optimization impact and determine if agent should be persisted permanently

### 5. Lifecycle Management
- **agent-lifecycle-manager**: Deploy, version, update, and maintain agent
- **Main Assistant**: Monitor agent usage patterns through system logs

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Create new agent for specific domain
task-orchestrator "Create a database migration agent" --workflow=agent-development

# Optimize existing agent performance
task-orchestrator "Improve code review agent performance" --workflow=agent-optimization

# Full lifecycle management
task-orchestrator "Deploy and monitor new authentication agent" --workflow=agent-deployment
```

## Evaluation Reports
All evaluation reports are automatically stored in `./evaluate_report/evaluate_id/` with timestamped filenames.

## Success Metrics
- Agent prompt shows clear structure and comprehensive coverage
- Performance demonstrates observable improvements
- User feedback indicates satisfaction
- Usage patterns show regular adoption
