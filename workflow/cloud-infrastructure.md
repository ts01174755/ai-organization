# Cloud Infrastructure Workflow

## Overview
Complete cloud infrastructure setup and management workflow using Infrastructure as Code principles.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Requirements & Design
- **juvenile-requirements-analyst**: Gather infrastructure requirements
- **juvenile-infrastructure-engineer**: Design cloud architecture
- **juvenile-cost-optimizer**: Estimate and optimize costs

### 2. Implementation
- **juvenile-infrastructure-engineer**: Create IaC templates
- **juvenile-container-captain**: Configure container orchestration
- **juvenile-api-gateway-architect**: Set up API gateways

### 3. Security & Networking
- **juvenile-security-guardian**: Configure security groups
- **juvenile-infrastructure-engineer**: Set up VPC and networking
- **juvenile-data-privacy-officer**: Ensure data residency compliance

### 4. Deployment & Automation
- **juvenile-deployment-orchestrator**: Set up CI/CD for infrastructure
- **juvenile-container-captain**: Deploy containerized services
- **juvenile-database-architect**: Configure database infrastructure

### 5. Monitoring & Optimization
- **juvenile-monitoring-sentinel**: Set up infrastructure monitoring
- **juvenile-cost-optimizer**: Implement cost controls
- **juvenile-incident-responder**: Configure disaster recovery

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Complete infrastructure setup
task-orchestrator "Set up AWS infrastructure for new project" --workflow=cloud-infrastructure

# Infrastructure migration
task-orchestrator "Migrate from on-premise to cloud" --workflow=cloud-migration

# Infrastructure optimization
task-orchestrator "Optimize cloud costs and performance" --workflow=infrastructure-optimization
```

## Success Metrics
- Infrastructure fully defined as code
- High availability (99.9%) achieved
- Cost optimization targets met
- Security best practices implemented
- Monitoring coverage 100%
- Disaster recovery tested
