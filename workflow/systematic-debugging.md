3. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Generate testable hypotheses with evidence-based reasoning

### Phase 2: Evidence Gathering
1. **consolidated-analysis-research-specialist**: Find relevant code patterns and error patterns across codebase
2. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Trace data flow paths for data-related issues
3. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Apply systematic logging and isolation techniques

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing
1. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Design minimal test cases for each hypothesis with automated testing
2. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Validate data transformations and pipeline integrity
3. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Use binary search methodology to isolate root cause

### Phase 4: Root Cause Verification & Fix Implementation
1. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Implement targeted fixes with comprehensive testing and validation
2. **consolidated-analysis-research-specialist**: Search for similar patterns that might have same issue
3. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Verify fix resolves original symptoms with production-ready delivery

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Complex production issue investigation
task-orchestrator "App crashes intermittently during peak hours, can't reproduce locally" --workflow=systematic-debugging

# Data pipeline corruption analysis
task-orchestrator "Customer data getting corrupted somewhere in 8-stage ETL pipeline" --workflow=data-corruption-debug

# Performance bottleneck identification
task-orchestrator "System slow under load, multiple potential causes" --workflow=performance-debug

# Legacy system issue resolution
task-orchestrator "Critical bug in inherited 50K line monolith" --workflow=legacy-debug
```

## Debugging Principles

### Methodical Approach
- Never dismiss intermittent issues
- Use binary search for isolation
- Document all hypotheses and test results
- Verify fixes resolve original symptoms

### Evidence-Based Analysis
- Collect objective data before theorizing  
- Test assumptions with minimal cases
- Use strategic logging and instrumentation
- Validate data invariants at each stage

### Systematic Coverage
- Search entire codebase for similar patterns
- Trace complete data flow paths
- Consider compound causes and interactions
- Apply domain expertise contextually

## Success Metrics
- Root cause identification rate > 95%
- Average resolution time < 4 hours
- Zero recurring issues after fix
- Complete system understanding documentation
