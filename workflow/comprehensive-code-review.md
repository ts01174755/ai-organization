# Comprehensive Code Review & Optimization Workflow

## Overview
High-performance integrated code analysis with cross-dimensional correlation, ROI quantification, and actionable optimization recommendations.

## Primary Workflow (Unified Approach)

### Single-Pass Comprehensive Review
**consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer** ⭐: Complete all-dimensional analysis in one integrated workflow
- Requirements compliance validation through comprehensive code auditing
- Security vulnerability detection with remediation strategies
- Performance bottleneck identification and optimization recommendations
- Code quality assessment with best practice enforcement
- Cross-dimensional correlation analysis across security, performance, and maintainability
- Automated testing integration for validation
- Domain-specific compliance (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)

### Output Analysis
- Executive summary with health score (A-F)
- Priority matrix (P0/P1/P2) with effort estimates  
- Issue interaction matrix showing compound risks
- Three fix paths (tactical/strategic/hybrid)
- Sprint-based implementation roadmap

## Specialized Deep-Dive Workflows

### Mathematical Code Verification
**math-verifier**: For numerical computations and statistical implementations
- Validate mathematical properties and correctness
- Check numerical stability and precision issues
- Verify statistical implementation accuracy

### Interface Evolution Management  
**interface-surgeon**: For API and system interface changes
- Analyze interface contracts and dependencies
- Plan safe migration strategies
- Implement version management with backward compatibility

### Performance Enhancement Pipeline
1. **consolidated-fullstack-data-engineer**: Identify performance bottlenecks with comprehensive analysis and implement optimizations
2. **juvenile-performance-cost-optimizer**: Analyze performance-cost tradeoffs and optimization strategies
3. **Main Assistant**: Validate improvement impact through systematic testing

## Domain-Specific Applications

### Financial Systems
- Automated PCI-DSS compliance checking
- Transaction integrity validation
- Regulatory requirement verification

### Healthcare Applications  
- HIPAA compliance assessment
- Patient data protection validation
- Medical device code standards

### E-commerce Platforms
- GDPR compliance verification
- Payment security validation
- Performance optimization for scale

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Comprehensive pre-deployment review
task-orchestrator "Review payment module comprehensively" --workflow=comprehensive-review

# Security-focused analysis
task-orchestrator "Security audit of authentication system" --workflow=security-review

# Performance optimization cycle
task-orchestrator "Optimize checkout flow performance with ROI analysis" --workflow=performance-optimization

# Interface evolution planning
task-orchestrator "Plan API v2 migration with zero downtime" --workflow=interface-evolution
```
