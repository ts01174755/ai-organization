# Full Stack Deployment Workflow

## Overview
Complete deployment pipeline from code to production, including testing, security scanning, containerization, and monitoring setup.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Requirements & Testing
- **juvenile-requirements-analyst**: Verify all requirements are met
- **juvenile-test-automation-engineer**: Generate and execute comprehensive test suites

### 2. Security & Quality
- **juvenile-security-guardian**: Perform security vulnerability scanning
- **juvenile-accessibility-auditor**: Ensure WCAG compliance
- **unified-code-auditor**: Comprehensive code quality review

### 3. Containerization & Deployment
- **juvenile-container-captain**: Create optimized Docker containers
- **juvenile-deployment-orchestrator**: Configure CI/CD pipelines
- **juvenile-infrastructure-engineer**: Provision cloud resources with IaC

### 4. API & Gateway Setup

- **interface-surgeon**: Ensure backward compatibility

### 5. Monitoring & Operations
- **juvenile-monitoring-sentinel**: Set up comprehensive monitoring
- **juvenile-log-analyzer**: Configure centralized logging
- **juvenile-cost-optimizer**: Optimize resource allocation

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Full production deployment
task-orchestrator "Deploy our microservices to production" --workflow=full-stack-deployment

# Pre-production validation
task-orchestrator "Validate deployment readiness" --workflow=deployment-validation

# Emergency deployment
task-orchestrator "Emergency hotfix deployment" --workflow=rapid-deployment
```

## Success Metrics
- All tests passing (100% required tests)
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Deployment time < 30 minutes
- Monitoring coverage > 95%
- Cost optimization targets met
